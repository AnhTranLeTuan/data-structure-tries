# Data Structure: Tries

## Description
Experiment with concepts of tries. In this project, we can see how:
* Create the private Node class that include the character field, the hash table for storing a large collection of nodes (the maximum number will be equivalent to the number of alphabet's  characters) and a boolean field for marking the end of the word
* Create attributes of the tries
* Add a string or the word into the tries (each node will store a single character, resulting in a collection of characters)
* Check if the tries contain a specific word 
* Remove the specific word from the tries
* Using the tries for providing autocompletion (return a list of string based on the provided prefix)
